** Spindle analysis tool ** is an open-sources cluster of tools with its ongoing development for a mejotic and mitotic spindle analysis. Key futures:
  
  1. Simple and intuitive to use with implemented UI. Only require installation of the R software environment and optional Rstudio.

2. It is designed from the ground up to incrementally scale up based on different use cases.

3. Allows working on projects reproducibly and compare data between them.

** Spindle analysis tool ** aims to replace huge and complicated to work with a spreadsheet which is frequently used for SpatialGraph analysis, but also it allows to uniform and completely automatize analysis process

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. You can also find up to date version of tools which past development phase on shinyapps.io server
[MT analysis tool](https://kiewisz.shinyapps.io/MT_length_distribtion/).

# Contribiut 
This set of tools is part of the MT analysis project. It is based on and evolves from ideas, contributions and constructive criticism of its users and collaborators.
