<h1>Microtubule length distribution analysis tool</h1>
<h5>*This analysis tool is part of the MT analysis program, which is work in progress.</h5>
<h3><strong>Instruction:</strong> </h3>

<h4>Upload file:</h4>
<p>The MT analysis tools working with Amira ZIB MT spatial graph file (.am).</p>
<p>MT spatial graph should contain Amira length analysis (using Spindle Analysis -> Length tool), and an exported .xml file should be converted to .xlsx (excel document file)class=""</p>
<p></p>
<p>To upload files for the analysis, move to the "Upload" are on your left. This tool supports up to 4 files.</p>
<p>When the file will be properly uploaded to the server, on the right side you will be able to validate the excel table.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Analysis:</h4>
<p>MT Length Distribution tool is able to recognize kinetochore microtubules (KMTs) from Non-KMTs. For this algorithm is searching for MT with labels starting with <strong>I)</strong> "Pole", or <strong>II)</strong> KMTs.</p>
<p>This tool is performing two operations on your data <strong>I)</strong> Length Histogram distribution, or <strong>II)</strong> Percanteg of MT to length distribution </p>
<hr />
<h4>Export data:</h4>
<p>To export data, simply move to "Export" part of the tool, select which data to export and download .csv file.</p>
<p>The downloaded file will contain data for selected analysis for each uploaded file, as well as average data if more then two files were uploaded</p>
